# ColorAnalysisTool
Desktop App that shows 5 colors with top concentration on image

## Info

### Algorythm does not work perfectly, especially on images with really similiar colors to each other, however it is not a crap
### Algorythm groups colors, selecting them accordingly to the distance gap between them in RGB cube, next it creates groups inside the major groups, just to find the leading color ( if it did not do this, the leading color would be the first color that algorythm scanned in the specific group
